# advent-of-code-2025
My advent of code attempts for 2025

You can find the link to the original problem statements, inputs, answers, and my python code solutions with my thought processes in here. Each problem has 2 parts. First part is more simple, and the second part is generally more complex.
I initially had the problem statements also included, but I forgot in the adventofcode website FAQ they did not want us to include those in our repos, so I removed it and linked it to the page instead. 

---------

Problems 1-6 are simple enough you can figure out on your own by thinking through it normally.  
Problems 7-12 are a bit more complicated, and you'll need to do additional thinking/analysis or have a background in CS to be able to work through.  

Each problem has 2 parts. The second part adds a bit of a twist, usually making the original problem a tiny bit more difficult. The second part does not unlock until you correctly answer first part.
